> A: The concept you're referring to is known as the "Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect." This term was coined by [[Michael Crichton]], based on his observations and discussions with the physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. The effect describes a situation where an individual, after encountering a news article in a field in which they have expertise and finding it riddled with errors and misunderstandings, will then turn the page and read another article in a different field, but assume it is accurate, even though it's written by the same journalist or media outlet. This phenomenon highlights the often overlooked fact that our assessment of the credibility of information can be inconsistently applied, especially when we step outside our areas of expertise.
