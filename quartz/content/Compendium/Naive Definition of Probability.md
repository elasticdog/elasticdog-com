The probability $P$ of an [[Statistics Glossary#Event|event]] $A$ is:

$$P(A) = {\text{\# favorable outcomes} \over \text{\# possible outcomes}}$$

This works if, for example, you think about a fair coin or dice roll.

However, the definition breaks down outside of the most trivial examples. Intuitively, the probability of aliens existing on the moon isn't ${1 \over 2}$ (either they do, or they don't); nor should the probability of blue aliens shaped specifically like a giraffe be equal to the probability of any aliens in general existing on the moon...it would be much less.
