I tend to write like I talk. I'm not big on flowery language or deep symbolism, but can appreciate [[Perfect Meeting Notes|those that have that gift]].
## ChatGPT's Analysis

After providing [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (v4 in April 2023) roughly a dozen samples of my own writing from different sources, I asked it to distill my writing style into a short description that I could use in a prompt later for generating additional writing. This is what it came up with:

>This writing style is clear, concise, and technical in nature, with a focus on explaining complex ideas and processes in a straightforward manner. It avoids using overly complicated jargon, instead opting for [[The Value of Simplicity|simpler explanations]] that are easy to understand. The tone is professional and authoritative, but also approachable and engaging, with occasional use of humor and personal anecdotes. Overall, this style strikes a balance between being informative and entertaining, making it ideal for technical writing and communication.

I'll start with that and see if I can refine it over time for generating text that sounds like me for future projects.

### Update

It doesn't always work.
