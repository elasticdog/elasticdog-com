 Reasoning from first principles is the process of breaking a problem down into the fundamental parts that are known to be true, and then building up a solution from there. It can apply to effectively learning new topics, as well as generating new solutions to problems, or redefining a problem so an existing solution can be employed. Make no assumptions.
