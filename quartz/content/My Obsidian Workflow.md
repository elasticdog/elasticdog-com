I'm trying to cultivate good knowledge management habits to learn more efficiently and explore my own thoughts more deeply/clearly.

- One idea per note...keep the units small and focused, like Git commits. It makes re-using thoughts easier, and multiplies the connections between them as well.
- [[Rewording Common Ideas|Writing in own words]], as much as possible
- Linking related ideas...[[Memory is Associative]]
- Regularly exploring the personal knowledge base. Related to spaced repetition and practice?

It's a secondary storage for your own brain, and can be a partner in communication that provides surprising insights through exploration.
