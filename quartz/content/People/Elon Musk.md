> _Though most of our life, we get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means kind of copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that, otherwise, mentally, you wouldn’t be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new you have to apply the physics approach. Physics has really figured out how to discover new things that are counter-intuitive, like quantum mechanics … so I think that’s an important thing to do. And then also, to really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from friends. This may sound like simple advice, but hardly anyone does that and it’s incredibly helpful."_
