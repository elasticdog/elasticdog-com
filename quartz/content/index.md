title: Welcome to My Digital Garden
---
This space is about capturing moments of insight and curiosity with minimal friction. It's a dynamic, living entity that contains my personal knowledge and free-form thoughts, not polished narratives. You'll find a collection of interconnected notes written to remember the things I've learned, clarify my own thinking, and discover new conceptual relationships.

Being "wrong" is part of the journey; [[Hanlon's Razor|don't assume malice]]. My ideas will evolve with time and experience...constructive feedback is always welcome. So, wander, explore, and let's cultivate this [[Digital Garden]] together!
