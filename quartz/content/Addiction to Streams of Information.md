Social media gives an instant gratification, and a bit of a dopamine rush by its constant stream of information. It can be overwhelming.

Related to the idea of [[Analysis Paralysis]] and not ever actually [[Optimize for Doing|applying the things I read about]]. I'd rather be productive than a passive consumer of random information flow...even if it seems like I'm doing legit research, it can be a rabbit hole.

I think [[Deep Work]] talked a bit about this as well and how it's merely shallow consumption without actually helping us with anything. More of a distraction and a literal addiction that makes it harder for us to think deeply about subjects and draw our own conclusions.
