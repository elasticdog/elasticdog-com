Aaron Bull Schaefer A-A-Ron, a renaissance man, a gentleman, and a scholar living in the Pacific Northwest. My [[Resume|professional background]] is in Information Technology, and after two decades in the field, I retired in April 2022. Throughout my career, I wore many hats, but think of myself as a _Senior DevOps Systems Engineer_. Ever the rational optimist, I believe that technology can and **should** be used to make people's lives better.
