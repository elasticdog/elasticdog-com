_I am not an academic_, and it's been over 15 years since I've had any formal math education. My strategy will be to prioritize practical, applied computational methods over complex mathematical proofs in pursuit of an intuitive understanding of modern statistics.

My pursuit is propelled by a fascination with recent AI breakthroughs, a concern for the [[Replication Crisis]] in scientific research, and a devotion to open access of knowledge.

Embracing a [[Work With the Garage Door Open]] mindset, I am dedicated to sharing the polished outcomes and the learning process alike. If you're also on a similar path to mastering Bayesian methods or have expertise to share, I'd love to [[ABS#Contact Me|hear from you]]!

## Objectives

My learning objectives are:

- To gain a functional understanding of Bayesian statistics and its application across different fields.
- To become proficient in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for statistical modeling and data analysis.
- To contribute to open-source knowledge and tools related to Bayesian methods.

## Why Julia?

Though [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) are prevalent languages in the realm of statistical programming, my choice to utilize Julia is driven by several compelling attributes:

- **Performance**: Julia is engineered for high performance, with capabilities to efficiently manage the complex computations required for statistical analysis.

- **Usability**: The language's elegant syntax and mathematical formulation align with my preferences, offering an intuitive coding experience. Julia's multiple dispatch paradigm facilitates a natural expression of sophisticated statistical models.

- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring consistent and verifiable results in statistics is paramount, and Julia's reproducible environments bolster the reliability of analyses conducted.

- **Future-Proofing**: Anticipating Julia's ascent in data science, I am embracing its expanding ecosystem, viewing this venture as an investment in a forward-looking technology.

Committed to this path, I will be translating and adapting reference materials originally in other languages into Julia, showcasing its adaptability and efficacy in statistical practice.
