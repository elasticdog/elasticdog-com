Everybody loves a good quote (myself included), but I'd like to present a counterpoint. The very act of pulling out a quote to reference elsewhere means losing all of the original context, and can actually inhibit your own ability to think beyond the quote and reframe it or connect to your own ideas. It's much better to think about and summarize the main point of a quote rather than just collecting them.
