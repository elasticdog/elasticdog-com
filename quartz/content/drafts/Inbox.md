- all knowledge in $\pi$

- apex domains, www vs bare

- longevity of thought: how long does knowledge last or hold up? any such thing
  as universal truth? relativity vs quantum mechanics

- aside from history and philosophy, is there any reason to study earlier
  advancements

- bootstrapping technology or civilization, it's relation to understanding stuff
  from first principles, charles petzold book

- link to ted chiang's short story about ai versus humans and progress

- perfectionism being a problem, self-pressure, the idea of good enough, 80/20
  rule, tied to personal finance journey as well, productivity, 4000 weeks book,
  the simple thing unintitively be more optimal (referenced in Algorithms for
  Life book), find recent YouTube video on doing the most things.

- why static asset allocation for life. find recent article about research
  suggesting you should't change asset allocation in retirement to be more
  conservative.

- learn in public, even though it's for me, not commercializing, chronological
  organization killed curated creativity and exploration (Amy Hoy's How the Blog
  Broke the Web; Stop Giving af and Start Writing More)

- gardening metaphor; seeds -> saplings -> fruit, much more intuitive compared
  to Zettlekasten. Not sure if I should lean more into the metaphor or leave it
  at that and use more obvious naming forthings like "Inbox" "Further Reading"
  "Inspiration", etc.

- summarize references of garden vs stream

- An "Inbox" is a mixed metaphor, but commonly understood. I think this can just
  be a note where I brain dump ideas (like this list) without having to think of
  note titles or "de-streaming" concepts. Or did I see a chatgpt plugin that
  might help create titles, so a dedicated note might not be necessary? I just
  want to reduce friction of capturing thoughts.

- ribozome structure of interconnected network, not a hierarchy (from author of
  Quartz)

- How do people logistically research history and collate facts? Recent example:
  Amy How's How the Blog Broke the Web, but there are lots. Deep Work's
  references, etc.

- "Commonplace Book" being the historical origin of a digital
  garden/zettlekasten/second brains (see article by Chris Aldrich).

- timeless way of building, a place must be lived in and adapted over time to
  reflect it's actual usage before it can become "alive". similar to a desire
  path. you can't plan everything out perfectly ahead of time, you have to make
  adjustments as you go. related to perfectionism/analysis paralysis/best
  practices.

- kaizen

- even following pattern languages, you can't do it blindly without
  understanding the intent behind the rules.

- I don't understand politics, lack of transparency, perverse motivations,
  common sense issues like inability to read laws before passing

- takeaways from the dictator's handbook

- privacy is important, nobody knows all the rules, rules change, metadata
  analysis is powerful and could be used against you.

- what about times I'm not a stickler for privacy, like owning a tesla. Brad
  posted about court case
  https://therecord.media/class-action-lawsuit-cars-text-messages-privacy

- learning in public at odds with privacy? cancel culture, acknoledgement that
  I'm probably wrong, but open to hearing about it. scientific process is
  adapting understanding based on new information.

- appeal of minimalism, tiny house movement too extreme but lots to learn from.

- passive homes

- a pattern language; has made me find modern aesthetic less appealing, too
  clinical

- thoughts on stoicism

- thoughts on atheism

- can businesses refuse to accept cash? cash has a link to privacy

- moving from customized to tools with better defaults (defaults matter). vim ->
  kakoune -> helix, bash -> zsh -> fish

- related to the above, I love auto-formatting tools `gofmt`, `rustfmt` and
  prefer them to be opinionated with less configuration. eliminate bikeshed
  arguments, focus on doing the work/solving problems and not minor details.
  consistency is more important than 100% agreement on aesthetics. They ease my
  own cognitive load.

- optimize for doing/producing

- mostly flat organization, minimal structure, but maybe references could have
  folders (books, games, movies, videos, papers, etc.) Maybe just tags for that?
  What is the dataview plugin for querying, would that help to maintain things
  automatically?

- how should I organize external references? zotero/citekeys for everything
  seems like a lot of overhead; not sure how aliases work in practice, but I
  think I need dedicated pages to notice patterns in the graph (like if I
  mention Deep Work in multiple contexts, that should be discoverable and not
  just a bunch of outbound links)

- terminology for external references? inspiration, pollenators, further
  reading, ???. Something may be thought provoking, not necessarily something I
  agree with.

- what's lacking is the federated aspect of easily sharing these ideas?

- self-directed learning for statistics

- Why Bayesian Statistics (vs Frequentist)

- self-directed learning for piano

- chatgpt and education ramifications; the cat's out of the bag, must adapt to
  new tools. progression of spell check, grammar check, grammarly/hemmingway,
  chatgpt. how best to learn?

- should one try to minimize usage of idioms?

- chatgpt as a force multiplier (human plus ai...yes, I know it's not ai).
  tapping into a high base level knowledge across literally all fields. can help
  make connections, be a good teacher, probe for deeper understanding, proof
  reader, helpful rubber duck debugger.

- long term ramifications of ai, artistic expression/creativity, lack of new
  training data, echo chamber, reversion to the mean.

- resonsibility to reduce bias vs accurate reflection of cultural biases

- ai replacement of jobs. universal income, collaborate to increase
  productivity, or adapt to better uses of human's natural abilities?

- HOWTO Publish an Obsidian Vault for Free; this would be a typical old-me blog
  post, but I do need to write up what I've done for my own reference. Maybe it
  would become a #fruit, or maybe it doesn't deserve as much polish?

- Do I not appreciate quotes as much as I used to? They're by definition taken
  out of context, but can still be great. "Sucking at something is the first
  step towards being sorta good at something."

- statistics are unintuitive; tied to interesting paradoxes

- algorithms for life; practical applications for some mathematical rules of
  thumb.

- optimizing the wrong thing. personal finance journey to a one-fund portfolio,
  a single human error could wipe out any minor advantage, sort of like
  automating a process, beauty in the simplicity which ends up being more
  optimal. kind of like index funds versus actively managed funds.

- capturing pure HOWTO references or facts, like my copyright notices gist that
  I look up regularly. is that even important to document anymore, considering
  chatgpt might be faster? Is it faster to search the broader internet than my
  own notes? Maybe if it's a resource that I wish existed and couldn't easily
  find?

- should index show list of recently touched pages? what about the pages that
  haven't been updated in the longest? is there an ability to show a random page
  to help myself remember older ideas?

- comfort crisis ties into a lot of ideas; rucking

- a second brain; I've Googled for answers before, found them, realized that I
  wrote the answer and just don't remember.

- following news is harmful; sensationalist, clickbait, made to stir up
  controversy and/or keep you in an echo chamber, overwhelming. people can't
  estimate risk and think outliers are more likely than they are (crime).

- axiom of trusting the expertise in what you read while seeing obvious errors
  in topics you know deeply.

- pull ideas and raw notes out of old nvalt archive?

- how can we know anything...recall the book read after conversation with Scott.

- replication crisis in academic research

- any concepts tied to hobbies, photography, watchmaking, drawing, exercise

- value of personal metrics; are they actionable

- the case for optimism...another book and Scott discussion.

- classic tuxedo

- short feedback loops

- graceful degradation...what doesn't work when javascript is off?

- explore if writing is not shared, does it still have value? remember reading
  someone making that point that it should always be shared, but writing is how
  we can think through problems ourselves. that said, there are many examples of
  great discoveries from people's notes only found after their death.

- lost knowledge, can old technology be adapted to new technology by
  understanding how it works. Thinking of Corridor Crew
  https://youtu.be/8q_HpSq95bw or
  https://www.bricetebbs.com/2023/11/09/varifocal-mirror/. Constraint breeds
  creativity. Think video game consoles.

- digital representation of analog mechanisms. great learning resource is the
  mechanical watch breakdown, allows you to visualize inside during simulation
  like cut-aways of physical items, but there's still something visceral about
  handling things directly. Slide rule.

- what is it that makes something objectively terrible? person/place/thing might
  be all different. for people, is it external impact, intent, lack of remorse
  (sociopath next door), attitude, something else? what is the tipping point of
  redemption?

- cancel culture link; can we separate work from the person? statistics flowers
  data set. does appreciation of a work mean support of the person? what if
  they're dead, does it still support them through notoriety, etc.?

- chatgpt used to infill connections between ideas (just like images).

- Tapping on Glass...universal way to seek attention. Is the woodpecker seeking
  my attention and I'm misunderstanding. Is there anything considered universal
  language with animals, maybe kindness? The Universal Greeting. Or just an
  idiot. What about other universal language (nuclear waste, space probes).
