Learning, as well as code development is boosted when you can minimize the time between getting feedback and applying what you've learned. Iterate on small changes and assimilate knowledge in between rather than ingesting a ton of information without reflection, or making big decisions based on incomplete information.

Useful also for product development ([[Lean Startup]]) to see if a proposed business model is viable.

Similar in idea to the Japanese term "[[Kaizen]]" for continual improvement in working practices and efficiency.
