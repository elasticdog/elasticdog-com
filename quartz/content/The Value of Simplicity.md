- Use simple words to convey ideas to make them more accessible (don't use "floccinaucinihilipilification"). But how simple is too simple? Vocabulary and jargon help to unify concepts into understanding, but can also be confusing. [[Richard Feynman]] quote about explaining concepts without the new words you just learned. Great presentation about the developing a language (Richard Joy?).

- [[Occam's Razor]]
- The [[Rule of Three]] in programming keeps things simple (don't add abstraction unnecessarily) until  the crossover point where its value becomes evident.
