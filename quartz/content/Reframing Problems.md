If you're blocked by a problem, you may be able to reframe the problem in a way where you can make progress, or at least establish some bounds which can help you to better understand your approach.

A deterministic problem may be possible to solve, but explodes in complexity through large numbers or exponential paths ([Arimaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Arimaa)) and it's not realistic to work through the Cartesian product of possibilities. Sampling predicted results could make the calculation manageable again...Sieve of Eratosthenes vs the Millerâ€“Rabin primality test.

deterministic versus probabilistic (is this equivalent to frequentist vs bayesian?).

A change of perspective, view things from another angle, think outside the box, etc.

Three types of constraint relaxation.

working backwards (there's a term for this)
