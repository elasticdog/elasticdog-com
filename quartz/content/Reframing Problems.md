If you're blocked by a problem, you may be able to reframe the problem in a way where you can make progress, or at least establish some bounds which can help you to better understand your approach.

A deterministic problem may be possible to solve, but explodes in complexity through large numbers or exponential paths (like [Arimaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa)) and it's not realistic to work through the Cartesian product of possibilities, just sampling the final answer could make the calculation manageable again. Sieve of Eratosthenes vs the Millerâ€“Rabin primality test.

A change of perspective

Three types of constraint relaxation.

working backwards (there's a term for this)

Sampling

deterministic versus probabilistic (is this equivalent to frequentist vs bayesian?)
