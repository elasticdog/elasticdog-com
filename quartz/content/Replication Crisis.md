There are many major issues that contribute:

- Pressure to publish in academia, regardless of quality. Perverse motives.
- Peer review is a poor filter for fraud.
- No motivation to reproduce some else's research. Hard to be convinced on that usage of grant money.
- Journals not as likely to publish negative findings, as they're perceived to have less value. They also don't typically care about reproduction of previous findings, which contributes to a lack of motivation for researchers to replicate them.
- Prestige and ego cause people to make poor choices.
- Journals could be considered scientific gatekeeping...normalizing open access could help?
- Honestly obtained incorrect results could lead to publication of outliers as they are surprising.
- Poor experimental design...suggestive wording in surveys, unreliable sources for sampling, overfitting, confounding issues, etc. Unfortunately, many studies require deep domain knowledge to understand why it's badly designed.
- p-hacking or hypothesis changing after the fact. 
- View that research is a means of influencing policy and public opinion rather than seeking truth.

Some fields like particle physics and astronomy actually do focus on reproducibility.

All boils down to a question of incentives?
