A digital garden represents a fresh perspective about sharing knowledge and ideas online. It's a way of [[Writing Forces Clarity of Thought|writing to think]], and reflects the organic cycle of intellectual exploration. Unlike a traditional blog that offers polished, chronological articles, a digital garden is a living, breathing collection of evolving thoughts and pathways. It's akin to an open journal, where ideas are continuously nurtured, pruned, and allowed to grow in new directions.

The format itself is not new, and many similar concepts exist:

- Commonplace Book
- Zettelkasten
- Second Brain
- Personal Wiki

...but for whatever reason, the garden metaphor clicks with me personally. The main difference in my mind from the other formats, is the emphasis on [[Learn in Public|learning in public]].

The publication of nascent thoughts, uncertainties, and half-finished ideas in their raw state allows for [[Feedback Loops]] and further learning by yourself and others. I appreciate that there is inherent value to community engagement and shared experience. This mindset also helps me to alleviate the self-imposed [[Perfectionism|pressure to perfect]] a piece of writing before making it public, and offers a more [[Work With the Garage Door Open|authentic representation of my process]].
