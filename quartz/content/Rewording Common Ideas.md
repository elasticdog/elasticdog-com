There are hundreds of descriptions out there on note taking and [[Digital Garden|digital gardens]], but including my own summary here helps me to understand more about what the concept means to me than just reading what other people have said. Including summaries of common ideas in my own network of thought also allows me to link to them and discover connections that wouldn't be possible through just referencing external websites.

Q: Am I just adding noise to concepts that have been expressed more eloquently elsewhere, or does it help to reinforce ideas that resonate with people?

A: If it provides value to me personally, maybe that doesn't matter.
