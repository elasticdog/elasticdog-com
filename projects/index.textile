Here are a few projects that I've been involved with in one form or another over the years. Click a banner below to see more details...

h2(#contributions). Contributions

h3(#archlinux). Arch Linux

!/images/projects/archlinux-banner.png(Arch Linux Distribution)!:http://archlinux.org/

I am a Trusted User for Arch Linux, meaning I contribute trusted binary packages to their community repository and help with special projects. I am also active in providing support on the forums and on IRC(Internet Relay Chat). For a list of the software packages I maintain, see "my community packages":https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?maintainer=aschaefer and "my AUR page":http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&K=elasticdog.

h3(#factor). Factor

!/images/projects/factor-banner.png(Factor Programming Language)!:http://factorcode.org/

Factor is "a general purpose, dynamically typed, stack-based programming language" that I have been experimenting with for a while now. I've had the opportunity to contribute back a decent amount of code to the project, including new math libraries, editor integration code, and numerous "Project Euler":http://projecteuler.net solutions using the language. I also wrote the "Pygments":http://pygments.org/ lexer for Factor, which is responsible for the syntax highlighting you see on this site as well as places like "GitHub":https://github.com/. I keep up to date with Factor's mailing list and IRC chatroom, and have begun writing a series of blog posts entitled "Beginning Factor":http://elasticdog.com/2008/11/beginning-factor-introduction/ to help others learn the language. I host a copy of Factor's git repository (including my contributions) on my projects subdomain: "http://projects.elasticdog.com/git/factor.git":http://projects.elasticdog.com/git/factor.git

h3(#wordpress). WordPress
