h1. Projects

Here are a few projects that I've been involved with in one form or another over the years. Click a banner below to see more details...

h2(#contributions). Contributions

h3(#archlinux). Arch Linux

!/images/projects/archlinux-banner.png(Arch Linux Distribution)!:http://archlinux.org/

I was a Trusted User for Arch Linux for almost 4 years (stepping down in Jan 2011 to free up time to work on other projects), meaning I contributed trusted binary packages to their community repository and helped with special projects. I maintained a large number of backup & security utilities, vim plugins, and web development tools. I am still active in the community, providing support on the forums and on IRC(Internet Relay Chat).

h3(#factor). Factor

!/images/projects/factor-banner.png(Factor Programming Language)!:http://factorcode.org/

Factor is "a general purpose, dynamically typed, stack-based programming language" that I have been experimenting with for a while now. I've had the opportunity to contribute back a decent amount of code to the project, including new math libraries, editor integration code, and numerous "Project Euler":http://projecteuler.net solutions using the language. I also wrote a "Pygments":http://pygments.org/ lexer for Factor, which is responsible for the syntax highlighting you see on this site. I keep up to date with Factor's mailing list and IRC chatroom, and have begun writing a series of blog posts entitled "Beginning Factor":/2008/11/beginning-factor-introduction/ to help others learn the language.

h3(#wordpress). WordPress

!/images/projects/wordpress-banner.png(WordPress CMS)!:http://wordpress.org/

I've used the WordPress blogging engine for a number of years and have written various plugins that have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. I still, on occasion, write about the technical side of WordPress on this site and continually contribute to the community in some capacity.
