<h3 id="archlinux">Arch Linux</h3>
<p><a href="http://archlinux.org/"><img src="/images/projects/archlinux-banner.png" alt="Arch Linux Distribution" height="80" width="512" /></a><br />
I am a Trusted User for Arch Linux, meaning I contribute trusted binary packages to their community repository and help with special projects. I am also active in providing support on the forums and on IRC. For a list of the software packages I maintain, see <a href="https://dev.archlinux.org/packages/?&#038;maintainer=aschaefer">my community packages</a> and <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&#038;K=elasticdog">my AUR page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="factor">Factor</h3>
<p><a href="http://factorcode.org/"><img src="/images/projects/factor-banner.png" alt="Factor Programming Language" height="80" width="512" /></a><br />
Factor is &#8220;a general purpose, dynamically typed, stack-based programming language&#8221; that I have been experimenting with for a while now. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to contribute back a decent amount of code to the project, including new math libraries, editor integration code, and numerous <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> solutions using the language. I keep up to date with Factor&#8217;s mailing list and IRC chatroom, and have begun writing a series of blog posts entitled <a href="http://elasticdog.com/2008/11/beginning-factor-introduction/">Beginning Factor</a> to help others learn the language. I host a copy of Factor&#8217;s git repository (including my contributions) on my projects subdomain: <a href="http://projects.elasticdog.com/git/">http://projects.elasticdog.com/git/</a></p>
