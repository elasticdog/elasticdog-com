	<p>While waiting for my tax refund, I&#8217;ve been checking out flat panel TVs and I ran across this article on a new ceramic flat panel technology in <a href="http://www.popsci.com">Popular Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Researcher Steve Yando has invented a ceramic panel that converts video signals into moving pictures. Yando did not have to invent a new way to convert electricity into light; flat electroluminescent panels to do that have been on the market for years. The problem was scanning: how to switch individual points of the panel on and off very rapidly to build up the quick-changing light-and-dark pattern of the TV image. &#8230;Yando solved the problem by pulling a very cute trick with piezoelectric crystals, which are old and long-used electric devices.</p>
<p>Piezo crystals convert mechanical movement to electricity, or electricity to mechanical movement; they work either way&#8230;.Yando&#8217;s trick was to make a piezo crystal work both ways at the same time &#8212; convert electricity to motion, the motion to electricity &#8212; and combine that with an electroluminescent panel to get light.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2007/04/popsci-diagram.png" title="Ceramic Panel Diagram" alt="Ceramic Panel Diagram" /></p>
<p>The dinner-plate picture panel is a flat rectangle of piezo ceramic (lead zirconate-titanate) coated with electroluminescent phosphor (a powder similar to fluorescent-lamp coating). Electrodes at the sides of the ceramic bring scanning voltages that determine which point will light up. Electrodes on the back and face of the panel bring TV picture-signal voltages that determine how bright the point will light up. (The face electrode has to be transparent so you can see the picture that is created.)</p>
<p>The scanning voltage causes a mechanical vibration to move across the ceramic in a line &#8211; like a long ocean wave. The vibration wave, in turn, generates a piezo voltage in the ceramic. So a line of voltage moves across the panel. But suppose you feed in two scanning voltages simultaneously, one to the top edge of the panel and one to a side edge. This gives you two moving lines of vibration waves and two moving lines of piezo voltage. Where the lines cross, you get a moving point of double piezo voltage. You can control the course of this point &#8211; make it scan across the panel &#8211; by doing things with the circuits in the TV receiver.</p>
<p>The electroluminescent layer will light up whenever there is a voltage. But you don&#8217;t want the moving lines to show at all, and even the moving spot must adjust it&#8217;s brightness to suit the TV picture signal. So a varying resistance cuts out all voltage at or below the double-strength piezo voltage &#8211; even the moving spot, unaided, won&#8217;t light up. But the additional voltage supplied by the picture signal can make the moving spot glow, changing it from dim to bright to create the entire image.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the article is a little old and lacking on display specifications, they did mention that a full-scale prototype has already been built. So I may end up waiting another year or so to see if this develops before looking for a new TV.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>
<p>Whew&#8230;talk about an April Fools Day-spurred adrenaline rush! I think we duped literally <b><span class="caps">TENS</span></b> of people with that one (not much response from <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a>, <a href="http://www.fark.com/">Fark</a>, or <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/">Shacknews</a>). This entry was the brain-child of my diabolical work friend James whom found this article in a 1961 version of Popular Science. Here are scans of the original article: <a href="/images/2007/04/page1.jpg">page one</a> and <a href="http://elasticdog.com/images/2007/04/page2.jpg">page two</a>. Hopefully next year we can get more traffic coming our way if we want to pull a successful prank on the internets. Live and learn&#8230;</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m currently in the middle of upgrading my WordPress installation to 1.5.1.3, and thus things might not be working quite right around here for a bit. I&#8217;m not dead, and I will be going back to my original design once I can take to time to develop a theme properly. With all all of the hacking I did to the default installation of WordPress 1.2.1, it could be a little while. Bear with me&#8230;thanks</p>

	<p>When creating a website, it&#8217;s best not to make experimental changes to your code directly on your server for the whole world to see. What if you accidentally mess things up beyond all recognition and don&#8217;t remember exactly what you did? It&#8217;s a good idea to test developmental changes in a protected environment where you know they won&#8217;t effect anything that&#8217;s mission critical. Typically this is simple to do as you can just edit the files on your local machine before uploading them. Making a test bed for <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, however, is a bit more difficult due to the nature of dynamic page generation.</p>
<p>WordPress uses <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"><span class="caps">PHP</span></acronym> to pull data from a database, and then subsequently creates the needed <acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language"><span class="caps">HTML</span></acronym> based off of that data. Without the <span class="caps">PHP</span>, your page would merely render as junk. Thus, in order to see a design change made in your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym>, you&#8217;re usually forced to upload the file to your server so WordPress has access to its heart and soul. Not anymore&#8230;</p>
<h2 id="sandbox">The Sandbox</h2>
<p>In an effort to make things easier on WordPress users wanting to customize the default installation, I&#8217;ve created a static version of the default <acronym title="WordPress"><span class="caps">WP</span></acronym> template and have placed it in a zip file along with a clean copy of <kbd>wp-layout.css</kbd> and <kbd>print.css</kbd>. The template includes a sample entry that utilizes many common <span class="caps">HTML</span> elements so you can tell exactly what they would look like on your page.</p>
<p>In this developmental sandbox, you can make structural code changes, try out new <span class="caps">CSS</span> techniques, whatever you want&#8230;all without having to worry about messing up your live site. Once you get things the way you like them, simply update your real files accordingly, and you&#8217;re good to go!</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Download <a href="http://elasticdog.com/code/2004/11/wp-design-sandbox.zip">wp-design-sandbox.zip</a></li>
	<li>Create a new directory on your local machine in which you&#8217;d like to place the test files</li>
	<li>Unzip the three files into the newly created directory</li>
	<li>Design away</li>
</ol>
