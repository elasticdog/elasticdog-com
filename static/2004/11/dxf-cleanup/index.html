<h1>Design by Fire Cleanup</h1>

<p>Last week, Andrei Herasimchuk of <a href="http://www.designbyfire.com/">Design by Fire</a> announced a contest to see who could take his site&#8217;s current design and &#8220;clean it up, optimizing it for best semantic and structural architecture.&#8221; Having the final code judged by three industry bigwigs (<a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Dean/">Dean Jackson</a>, and <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a>), Andrei is offering the winner their choice of any three <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/main.html">Adobe products</a>. It&#8217;s a widely known fact that software from Adobe is like crack to designers, so I figured I&#8217;d have a go at it.</p>
<p>I by no means would consider myself an &#8220;expert&#8221; on web standards (at least not in the same league as these guys), but my anal-retentive temperament <em>has</em> provided me with the abnormal patience to sit down and scour the web for details regarding this subject matter. I&#8217;d like to think that although I may not have a lot of industry experience, I have read tons about web standards and do enough work on my own to offer advice when it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>The contest consisted of cleaning up three different pages of code, and also optimizing the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></acronym> involved in creating the look of Andrei&#8217;s site. Initially underestimating the amount of time it would take to complete this cleanup, I immediately downloaded the necessary source code and began hacking away.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2004/11/dxf-code.jpg" title="Screenshot of DxF Code" alt="Screenshot of DxF Code" /></p>
<h2 id="results">The Results</h2>
<p>After about four days of working on the contest, creating three new images, having two bloodshot eyes, and one neglected girlfriend, I decided my pseudo redesign was complete. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not perfect, but I can honestly say that it <em>is</em> better.</p>
<p>Overall, my changes make the site much more consistent&#8230;not only in its structure, but in the way it&#8217;s displayed across different browsers and platforms. It&#8217;s also much more accessible, much more semantic, <em>and</em> it tastes like chicken!</p>
<p>The final judging for the contest has yet to take place, but I&#8217;m crossing my fingers. Even if I don&#8217;t win the software, it has been a good way for me to flex my design muscles &#8212; plus there&#8217;s the added bonus of three <strong>very</strong> prominent designers in the industry who will be looking closely at my work.</p>
<p>If any of my readers are interested in seeing the completed code (yes, I&#8217;m talking to both of you), the three pages can be found here:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/dxf/">DxF Homepage</a></li>
	<li><a href="/dxf/cat_design.html">DxF Categorical Archive</a></li>
	<li><a href="/dxf/000146.html">DxF Sample Entry</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve also created <a href="http://elasticdog.com/dxf/contest.zip">a zip file</a> that contains all of the new code, images, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and source files used in creating my entry. Inside the zip, you&#8217;ll also find a changelog that discusses the improvements I made in more detail.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
