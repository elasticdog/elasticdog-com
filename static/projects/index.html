	<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Here are a few projects that I&#8217;ve been involved with in one form or another over the years. Click a banner below to see more details&#8230;</p>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<h3 id="archlinux">Arch Linux</h3>
<p><a href="https://archlinux.org/"><img src="/images/projects/archlinux-banner.png" title="Arch Linux Distribution" alt="Arch Linux Distribution" /></a></p>
<p>I was a Trusted User for Arch Linux for almost 4 years (stepping down in Jan 2011 to free up time to work on other projects), meaning I contributed trusted binary packages to their community repository and helped with special projects. I maintained a large number of backup &amp; security utilities, vim plugins, and web development tools. I am still active in the community, providing support on the forums and on <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat"><span class="caps">IRC</span></acronym>.</p>
<h3 id="factor">Factor</h3>
<p><a href="https://factorcode.org/"><img src="/images/projects/factor-banner.png" title="Factor Programming Language" alt="Factor Programming Language" /></a></p>
<p>Factor is &#8220;a general purpose, dynamically typed, stack-based programming language&#8221; that I have been experimenting with for a while now. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to contribute back a decent amount of code to the project, including new math libraries, editor integration code, and numerous <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> solutions using the language. I also wrote a <a href="https://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> lexer for Factor, which is responsible for the syntax highlighting you see on this site. I keep up to date with Factor&#8217;s mailing list and <span class="caps">IRC</span> chatroom, and have begun writing a series of blog posts entitled <a href="/2008/11/beginning-factor-introduction/">Beginning Factor</a> to help others learn the language.</p>
<h3 id="wordpress">WordPress</h3>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/"><img src="/images/projects/wordpress-banner.png" title="WordPress CMS" alt="WordPress CMS" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used the WordPress blogging engine for a number of years and have written various plugins that have been downloaded tens of thousands of times. I still, on occasion, write about the technical side of WordPress on this site and continually contribute to the community in some capacity.</p>
