title:     Give WordPress its Own Directory on Nginx
---
So you want the files for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> to be in a subdirectory while still running your blog out of the root directory?  If your server is running <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, then <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory">it's pretty straight forward</a> to do.  Trouble is, what if you want to run a web server that's a little faster and lighter on resources, like <a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a>?  Here's how to do it...

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You should already have WordPress installed and running on Nginx...if not, see <a href="http://elasticdog.com/2008/02/howto-install-wordpress-on-nginx/">HOWTO: Install WordPress on Nginx</a> before continuing.  This guide will assume that you originally extracted the WordPress core files here: <code>/srv/www/nginx/domain.com/</code>

<h3 id="why">Why Do This?</a>

Moving WordPress's core files into their own subdirectory on your server has a couple of benefits...

<ol>
	<li>It makes things more tidy so that WordPress doesn't clutter up your root directory with a bunch of files you don't really need to look at</li>
	<li>It makes upgrading WordPress easier since you don't have to figure out which files were made by you and which files you shouldn't touch</li>
	<li>You can then easily serve other pages from your domain that aren't directly under WordPress's control...for example I have <a href="http://elasticdog.com/movies">http://elasticdog.com/movies/</a> hosted under the same directory structure</li>
</ol>
