I'm currently in the middle of upgrading my WordPress installation to 1.5.1.3, and thus things might not be working quite right around here for a bit. I'm not dead, and I will be going back to my original design once I can take to time to develop a theme properly. With all all of the hacking I did to the default installation of WordPress 1.2.1, it could be a little while. Bear with me...thanks
