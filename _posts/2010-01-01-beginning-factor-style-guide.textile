keep lines under 64 characters
indentation (conditionals, etc.)
naming conventions
4 spaces
preference of combinators over shufflers


    * Most word definitions should fit in three or fewer 64-column lines.
    * Any copy/pasted code should be factored out into new words.
    * Use combinators to abstract control flow patterns.
    * Use library words where possible.
    * More general words should go at the top of a file; more specific at the bottom.
    * Try to use collections instead of working with individual objects on the stack.
    * Don't use the datastack as a data structure.
    * Use meaningful word names. Avoid too many words named (foo) or foo*.
    * A word named (foo) should only exist to help implement the word foo.
    * Come to the IRC channel and we'll review your code. It's fun!
