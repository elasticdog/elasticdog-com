I'm awful at writing reviews for media I've consumed. I can usually figure out why I _don't_ like something, but find it harder to articulate the things I'm drawn to in a book or a movie. I would say that it's typically something though provoking, on a topic that I find interesting...but I also sometimes just want an escape where I can suspend disbelief and just enjoy a mindless action adventure.

Anything beyond trying to bucket a rating into a 5-point scale is probably too granular for me, but I'm also not consistent with my own rating structure/meaning, so haven't tried keeping track of those on a regular basis.

Perhaps through writing more, I'll be able to tease out common themes and styles that I find engaging. At the very least, I'll try and write down topics that are touched upon in order to make some mental connections.

Related to why I don't read much fiction?
