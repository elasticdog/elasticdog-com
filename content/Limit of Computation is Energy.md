Interesting analysis on cryptographic key sizes and how long it would take to _brute force_ large operations, even in the future. "Time is not the bottleneck, energy is."

Note that this wouldn't apply to discovered algorithmic methodologies that improve factorization techniques and/or narrow the bounds of the search space.

Related to [[Landauer's Principle]].
