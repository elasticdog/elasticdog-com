How do people track down the origin of an idea?!

Is it really just reading, finding references, and more reading until the line ends? I could see that in academic research where you'll have an obvious path of citations to follow, but not in other contexts. I struggle to understand how people can be confident in knowing that they've found an original source. How are you sure it's not just a dead end from a branch that split long ago and there are even earlier references? Do you just put something out there once you've reached a certain confidence level and then wait to be corrected by someone else doing their own research (a variation of [[Cunningham's Law]])?

Related to the ideas of [[Research Debt]], patents getting credit, parallel discoveries.
## Examples

On page 133 of [[How to Take Smart Notes]], it talks about the idea of "brainstorming" and how it was described in 1919 by Alex Osborn and more broadly introduced in 1958 in the book "Brainstorming: The Dynamic New Way to Create Successful Ideas" from Charles Hutchinson Clark.

Something I appreciate about this book and those by [[Cal Newport]] are the vast amounts of cross references and quotes to support their thinking, but maintaining all of these and pulling them together seems like a huge task.
