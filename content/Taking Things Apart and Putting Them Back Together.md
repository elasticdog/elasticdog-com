The act of deconstructing (and hopefully re-constructing) an item can lead to deeper understanding. That not only applies to items in the physical world, but also to breaking down complex ideas. It applies equally to mechanical watches or a piece of music.

There's something intrinsically appealing about the process of methodical focus and experimentation when getting into the inner workings of something complicated. Having a strong attention to detail allows you to uncover motivations for the way that things are designed.

You can hone your intuition through the process alone, and pairing it with external resources gives you a way to enhance learning.
