The structure made available for organizing digital sheet music within the iOS app [forScore](https://forscore.co/) is deep and flexible. It's best to plan out how you expect to browse and search for music within your collection, which will dictate how you organize all the the associated metadata for each piece.

After a lot of trial and error when I first started collecting sheet music and adding it into forScore, I've settled on some guidelines that work well for my scenario, and thought I should write them down.

## Context

I am an adult that recently started piano lessons for the first time (ignoring a brief stint over 30 years ago). I have no plans to join a band, orchestra, or choir...my focus is solely on learning to play solo piano pieces for my own enjoyment.

My current piano teacher adapts quickly based on my progress, problems, and preferences. That means that assigned pieces are pulled from numerous books and online sources, rather than blindly following a single method book from cover to cover. It quickly became apparent that the pile of physical paper I was carrying around would soon become unmanageable, and thus I wanted to explore storing my sheet music digitally on an iPad.
