[forScore](https://forscore.co/), a widely used application for cataloging and viewing sheet music, offers a sophisticated yet flexible way to manage your personal library. However, the app's extensive metadata fields can be overwhelming without a clear strategy, often requiring significant experimentation to navigate effectively. After exploring various approaches, I've established a set of organizational guidelines that have streamlined the way I categorize and access my sheet music.
## Libraries

A _Library_ is the highest level of organization in forScore. You're either viewing "All Libraries" or a subset of pieces. Segmentation at this level is purely for convenience, and an individual piece can be included in multiple libraries.

To help reduce noise and facilitate quick access during focused practice sessions, I separate out reference material like scales, arpeggios, and method exercises from musical pieces. My two libraries are currently:

- **Music Theory** 
- **Solo Piano**

If I played multiple instruments or was a member of a band/choir/orchestra, I would have a dedicated library for each context.
