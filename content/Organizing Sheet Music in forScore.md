[forScore](https://forscore.co/), a widely used application for cataloging and viewing sheet music, offers a sophisticated yet flexible way to manage your personal library. However, the app's extensive metadata fields can be overwhelming without a clear strategy; it can take some experimentation to sort out how to navigate effectively. After exploring various approaches, I've established a set of organizational guidelines that have streamlined the way I categorize and access my sheet music.
## Libraries

A library is the highest level of organization in forScore. You're either viewing "All Libraries" or a subset of scores. Segmentation at this level is purely for convenience, and an individual piece can be included in multiple libraries.

To help reduce noise and facilitate quick access during focused practice sessions, I separate out reference material like scales, arpeggios, and method exercises from musical pieces. My two libraries are currently:

- **Music Theory** 
- **Solo Piano**

If I played multiple instruments or was a member of a band/choir/orchestra, I would have a dedicated library for each context.

## Bookmarks

Bookmarks in forScore, applied _after_ importing a PDF file for a score, are pivotal in my organizational strategy. They allow me to cluster related pieces together, reflecting their compilation in the physical world. Thinking ahead about grouping scores, whether they stand alone or belong to a series, shapes the structure of my digital documents.

> You can use forScore's [rearrange](https://forscore.co/documentation/rearrange/) feature to make structural changes to your documents by merging several PDF files together or by splitting one into individual parts, even after they've been imported.

The dual advantage of using bookmarks lies in preserving the natural groupings of pieces, as they are often found in physical collections, while also enhancing digital navigation. This approach not only preserves the contextual relationships among related scores but also facilitates the discovery of individual pieces by generating "virtual items" through bookmarks, in turn making the library more intuitive.

For example, to catalog Bach's ["Cello Suite No. 1 in G major"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Suites_(Bach)), I would ensure that all six movements are contained within a single document for holistic access. Then, each movement—Prelude, Allemande, and so forth—would be individually bookmarked, making it trivial to jump to a specific section as needed.
