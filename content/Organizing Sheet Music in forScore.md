[forScore](https://forscore.co/), a widely used app for cataloging and viewing sheet music, offers a sophisticated yet flexible way to manage your personal library. However, the app's extensive metadata fields can be overwhelming without a clear strategy, often requiring significant experimentation to navigate effectively. After exploring various approaches, I've established a set of organizational guidelines that have streamlined the way I categorize and access my sheet music.
## Libraries

A _Library_ is the highest level of organization in forScore. You're either viewing "All Libraries" or a subset of pieces. Segmentation at this level is purely for convenience, and an individual piece can be included in multiple libraries.

I like separating out reference material like scales, arpeggios, and method exercises from musical pieces:

- **Music Theory** 
- **Solo Piano**

This helps to reduce noise and facilitates quick access during focused practice sessions. If I played multiple instruments or played in groups, I would have a dedicated library for each.
