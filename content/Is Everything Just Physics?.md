Do all rabbit holes of knowledge eventually just lead to material science and physics? At the lowest levels of understanding, someone had to make a decision on what works best.

Computers -> high level programming language -> low level programming language -> assembly and processor instruction sets -> chip design -> circuit board design -> electricity, speed of light, quantum mechanics

Art -> color and light interactions, experience comes through physiology, development of pigments (historical and modern, like vanta black)

Psychology -> ultimately just neurochemicals and electrical synapses?

mechanical watches -> transfer of potential energy from the spring, friction, oil properties like viscosity, Mohs scale applied to jewels
