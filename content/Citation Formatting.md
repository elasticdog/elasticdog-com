Need to explore how to maintain citation references.

Links with page numbers for actual print articles, for example: (pp 55â€“56, 1) p. is used to denote 1 page, pp. to denote a range of pages. This form of citation is used when you are using brief/in text citations.

Use the BibLaTeX shorthand in combination?

Look at "in-text citation" styles.

Also "Cf.", which is often used to indicate that the reader should compare or refer to another source or passage for additional information, context, or a related point...but it's also not intuitive if you haven't seen it before.
