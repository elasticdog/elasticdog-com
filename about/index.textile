h1(#aaron). About Aaron Bull Schaefer

!/images/about/aaron-bull-schaefer.jpg(It's a me...Aaron Bull Schaefer-io!)!

I'm a certifiable renaissance man, gentleman, and scholar. I have been working in the IT(Information Technology) field since 2002 and am currently employed as a Systems Engineer at "Wolfram Research":http://www.wolfram.com/, the makers of "Mathematica":http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/ and "Wolfram|Alpha":http://www.wolframalpha.com/. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer & Information Technology (specializing in Network Engineering) from Purdue University, graduating with highest distinction. I am passionate about security, automation, and using technology to make people's lives better. It's rumored that I may someday rule the world.

If you'd like to see some of the projects I've been involved in, take a gander at my aptly named "projects page":/projects/ or my personal "code repositories":http://projects.elasticdog.com/. You can easily find me all over the intertubes, but here are a few places to get you started:

h2(#contact). Contact Me

!{float:right;margin-right:-25px;margin-top:-2.75em;}/images/about/contact-qrcode.png(MECARD Formatted QR Code)!

If you'd like to reach me for any reason, send an email to *"aaron@elasticdog.com":mailto:aaron@elasticdog.com*. I'm also constantly checking the horizon for smoke signals and carrier pigeons, if that's your thing. If you'd prefer a more secure means of communication, keep on reading...

h3(#gnupg). My GnuPG Public Key

"GNU Privacy Guard":http://www.gnupg.org/ (a.k.a. GnuPG or GPG) is <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">==F/OSS==</acronym> that allows you to easily sign and encrypt your data. This enables you to verify people's identities and protect your privacy when communicating online. If you would like to communicate securely with me, you will need to download my public key:

pre. pub   1024D/50EDFCCD 2008-05-31
      Key fingerprint = 7074 406E 8272 D083 1E31  2845 666F D4C1 50ED FCCD
uid                  Aaron Bull Schaefer <aaron@elasticdog.com>
sub   2048g/388B7E9C 2008-05-31 [expires: 2012-12-21]

You can import it from any keyserver, or by downloading the "ASCII-armored version":/code/elasticdog-pubkey.asc manually. *DO ==NOT==* forget to verify the key against the fingerprint listed above to ensure that they are the same. For more information, see "The GNU Privacy Handbook":http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html.

h1(#elasticdog). About This Site

ElasticDog.com is *not* a typical blog...rather than taking a snapshot of my ideas on a particular date and leaving the entries to grow stale over time, I've choosen to produce a site that is always up-to-date and can evolve right along with rest of the world. The information you read here will always be an accurate reflection of my _current_ ideas on various topics covering technology, standards-based web design, personal finance, photography, programming, unicorns, pirates, whatever. Everything I write is "under version control":http://projects.elasticdog.com/git/elasticdog-com.git, so you still have the ability to reference historical versions of the articles, if so desired.

I _highly_ encourage participation through "email correspondence":#contact and writing thought-out responses published via your own chosen platform; but the ability to leave comments here directly has been turned off. If you get in touch and our conversation generates any interesting dialog, there's a good chance that I'll add more details to the appropriate article or write something entirely new. We'll see how this experiment goes!

h2(#retired). Retired Articles

It's inevitable that certain topics will fall out of favor and no longer be pertinent to myself or global citizens at large, so eventually, articles will be tagged as "retired" and de-emphasized site-wide. That way people don't have to worry about if the information they read here is applicable now, or if it was only applicable three years ago when it was first published. The distinction will be made abundantly clear.

h2(#colophon). Colophon

ElasticDog.com is hosted on a VPS(Virtual Private Server) from "Linode":http://www.linode.com/ along with a number of my other sites. The server runs "Nginx":http://wiki.nginx.org/Main on top of "Arch Linux":http://www.archlinux.org/ and has its configuration managed via "Chef":http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home using the "Opscode Platform":http://www.opscode.com/. The site itself is completely static, but uses a combination of "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll with "RedCloth":http://redcloth.org/ to generate the HTML(Hypertext Markup Language), and "Compass":http://compass-style.org/ with "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ to generate the CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). The site's syndication feed is also generated by Jekyll, but ultimately gets distributed via "FeedBurner":http://feedburner.google.com/.

It's all tracked with "Git":http://git-scm.com/ and can be freely explored in my "code repositories":http://projects.elasticdog.com/git.

h2(#design). Design

Although it wasn't my first website, I created ElasticDog.com when I began learning about web standards back in 2003. I started off using "Movable Type":http://www.movabletype.org/ as a blogging engine, and unfortunately neglected to convert all of my entries when I later switched to "WordPress":http://wordpress.org/. Over the years, I've updated the look of this site a number of times...click a banner below to be transported into the past.

h3(#2008). 2008

!/images/about/elasticdog-2008-banner.png(ElasticDog.com's Design from 2008)!:/images/about/elasticdog-2008.png

The 2008 design of ElasticDog.com was not created by me, but was a highly-customized version of "Essay", a "Sandbox":http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/ theme by "Ian Stewart":http://upperfortstewart.com/. The idea was that I could ignore the complexities of WordPress theme creation and get back to focusing on writing, but you can "see how that went":/archives/.

h3(#current). Current Design

The current design of ElasticDog.com (completed in October 2010) is another attempt at getting back to basics. I started with the idea of making the site look similar to output from "Readability":http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/, but went further to enhance its typography, color palette, and structure to better represent the content I write. The design is intentially minimal, but with close attention paid to the details.
