<h2 id="aaron">About Aaron Schaefer</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m a certifiable renaissance man, gentleman, and scholar.  I have been working in the IT field since 2002 while simultaneously earning my degree in Computer &#038; Information Technology (specializing in Network Engineering) from Purdue University.  Working full-time while earning my degree has given me a unique blend of knowledge and experience that I wouldn&#8217;t trade for anything.  It&#8217;s rumored that I may someday rule the world&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to see some of the projects I&#8217;ve been involved in, take a gander at my aptly named <a href="http://elasticdog.com/projects/">projects page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="gnupg">My GnuPG Public Key</h3>

If you would like to communicate securely with me, you will need to download my public key:</p>

<h2 id="elasticdog">About This Site</h2>

<p>ElasticDog is the place where I house all of my musings on technology, standards-based web design, personal finance, the arts, programming, life, pirates&#8230;whatever strikes my fancy.  I tend to write a lot of &#8220;howto&#8221; articles on various technical subjects, usually stemming from when I have to research something complicated and don&#8217;t want to forget how I did it.  If my writing can also help other people, then all the better!  Participation is always welcome.</p>
<h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3>
<p><img src="/images/about/scrooge.jpg" alt="Scrooge McDuck" class="alignright" height="172" width="200" /> ElasticDog is hosted on a <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> from <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">SliceHost.com</a> along with a number of my other sites.  If you&#8217;re comfortable on the command line, then running a VPS is leaps and bounds better than any cheap shared hosting, and not that much more expensive.  I know bloggers are always excited to promote their web host in hopes of someday swimming in all the referral money like Scrooge McDuck, but I don&#8217;t really care about that.  If just one person chooses SliceHost over Dreamhost and their ilk, then my work here is done.  For all I care, tell &#8216;em Large Marge sent ya&#8230;</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>Although it wasn&#8217;t my first website, I created ElasticDog when I began learning about web standards back in 2003.  I started off using <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> as a blogging engine, and unfortunately neglected to convert all of my entries when I later switched to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.  Over the years, I&#8217;ve updated the look of this site a number of times&#8230;click a banner below to be transported into the past.</p>
